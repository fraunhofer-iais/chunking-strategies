                    "will be routed to the application in WAS. But everything else (static content) will be handled by the IHS web server itself.\n\n\nANSWER\nIf you want to serve any static files (JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc) from your web application in WAS, you must use fileServingEnabled=\"true\" in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file. That will cause the plug-in to use a wildcard entry for the context-root of your web application. For example, if the context-root is \"myapp\", then there will be a URI entry for \"/myapp/*\" in the plug-in",
                    "under the IHS DocumentRoot directory. And put the static files that you want IHS to serve into that directory. For example in the IHS document root directory (HTTPServer/htdocs/) create a subdirectory called \"static\". Something like this:\n/usr/IBM/HTTPServer/htdocs/static/\n\n2) In your web application, you will reference those files using relative references like \"static/picture.jpg\", or \"static/mystyles.css\".\n\nThose relative references will be interpreted as URLs like this:\n/myapp/static/picture.jpg\n/myapp/static/mystyles.css\n\nKeep in mind that there really is NOT any",
                    "/static/$1 [PT]\n\nWhich assumes the files themselves are placed in [IHS_DOC_ROOT]/static/.\n\n4) For the static files in the application, you will need to put them in some other directory that is NOT called \"static\", for example \"images/sunset.jpg\" would be a directory and file in the myapp application. This URL request, would be handled by the Plug-in and sent to the application in WAS:\nhostname/myapp/images/sunset.jpg\n\n\nSo, by using the trick described above, some static files will be served from IHS,",

                    "answer": "When tuning WebSphere Portal at version 6.0 and beyond, one of the concerns that arises is how should one tune the maximum number of Portal datasources. Portal can and does make heavy internal use of datasources, so miscalculating this (maximum) value can have a significant impact on system behavior. Out of the box, the default maximum setting is 50. This may or may not be sufficient for any given system. \n\nEach Portal request may make any number of database (DB) requests ranging for none to several.. Further, customized portlets and PPR (Parallel Portlet Rendering) may cause several concurrent DB requests. By default, the maximum number of WebContainer threads is also set to 50. Therefore the ratio between the maximum number of Portal datasource connections to the maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads is 1:1. Support has found that this ratio is often too low for the best performance. In the past, there have been recommendations of this ratio as high as of 2:1 or even 2.5:1. \n\nHowever, these values caused concern in large deployments where the TOTAL number of maximum datasource connections might start to place a strain on backend resources. Recent analysis suggests that these ratio values may be safely reduced to 1.25: 1 for all Portal datasource, with the exception of the jcrDB when WCM is used extensively. In this case, we recommend a ratio of 1.5:1",
