                    "THE PROBLEM\nThe simplest steps to resolve the 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED errors in a development environment, where full transport security is not required, are as follows: \n\n 1. Choose a user that you want WebSphere Application Server to be authenticated as. Typically the user chosen should have authority relevant to the context of the operations required by the application running in WebSphere Application Server and no more. For example, 'mqm' or other super user is not appropriate. \n 2. If this user is an MQ administrative user, then relax the Channel Authentication Record (CHLAUTH) security in MQ V7.1 or higher, so that administrative connections are not blocked on the SVRCONN channel you wish to use. An example MQSC command to do this for a SVRCONN channel called 'WAS.CLIENTS' is provided as follows:\n    SET CHLAUTH('WAS.CLIENTS') TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST(ALLOWANY) \n 3. Configure the SVRCONN channel to set the MCA user ID (MCAUSER) to the user you have chosen. An example MQSC command to configure a SVRCONN channel to use 'myuser' as the MCA user ID is",

Linux systems running WebSphere Application Server are a particular case. The nproc limit on Linux counts the number of threads within all processes that can exist for a given user. To determine the ulimit settings of a WebSphere Application Server process running on Linux refer to \"How to determine the ulimit settings of a running WebSphere Application Server process on Linux [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21407889]\".\n\nUser Limits (in bytes except for NOFILE and NPROC) \n\ntype soft limit hard limit RLIMIT_AS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CORE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CPU unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_DATA unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_FSIZE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_LOCKS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_MEMLOCK 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NOFILE 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NPROC 131072 131072 \n\nFor most cases of older versions of Linux this value will be defaulted to around",

Increasing the limit to the suggested value should have no negative impact. When the number of threads in all processes reaches the -u ulimit, an out of memory error message will be thrown.

This rules out SSO tickets like Kerberos tokens or SAP tokens as they will expire after a short time and will become unusable.

However, for SSO based authentication to IBM Cognos BI, there is no password available to the namespace that can be stored into the trusted credential.

                    "historical data, etc. from CANDLEHOME to a different file system? \n\nCAUSE\nSince its inception, IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) has stored local data such as configuration files, log files, and historical data together with the installation files in CANDLEHOME. For example, ITM normally installs in a directory named /opt/IBM/ITM. Within that directory, it stores programs in subdirectory names like /opt/IBM/ITM/bin and /opt/IBM/ITM/classes. It also stores local data in subdirectory names like /opt/IBM/ITM/config and /opt/IBM/ITM/logs. This homogeneous design is a problem for installations that require an approach that keeps code in /opt and stores data in the /var file system.\n\nANSWER\nIntroduction \n\nUnder APAR IV67523, ITM added a new mechanism to move local data to a different file system. For example, data typically stored in /opt/IBM/ITM/config and /opt/IBM/ITM/logs can be redirected to /var/IBM/ITM/config and /var/IBM/ITM/logs.

Specifying a ruleset path with no version ( such as /MyRuleApp/MyRuleset/ ) is interpreted as a request to execute the highest version of the ruleset, as opposed to a version specific ruleset path ( such as /MyRuleApp/2.0/MyRuleset/1.0 ). Validate that the executed ruleset path is indeed unexpected considering the requested ruleset path. \n\n \n\nA common situation for an unexpected ruleset version to be executed is that of a hot deployment that is not successfully completed.

The Crypto profiles now have TLSv1.2 and 1.1 which will be enabled by default. This affects the protocol version included in the Client Hello when DataPower is acting as the SSL client. If TLSv1.2 is not supported, the server still negotiates to the most secure supported protocol (e.g. TLSv1.1, TLSv1.0, SSLv3) if enabled. \n\nSome legacy servers with non-compliant implementations of SSL may reject connection attempts when TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.1 are used. In these cases, the",

In these cases, the handshake fails without properly negotiating to a mutually agreeable protocol.\n\nThe TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2 are part of the requirements for being compliant with NIST SP800-131a.\n\n\n\nANSWER\nUpgrade the SSL server to a version compliant with the SSL/TLS specifications. If required you may disable TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.1 within the Crypto Profile to allow compatibility. \n\n\nWithin the domain simply navigate to the Objects> Crypto Configuration> Crypto Profile>\nThen simply click on your specific profile to view the Options selection and see what SSL protocol versions are supported.\n\nAny further questions or issues please feel free to contact DataPower support.

For example, for WebSphere Application Server, check the \"Maximum transaction timeout\" and increase it as needed as described here [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tjta_settlog.html].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 7.5 Enterprise Business",

You may need to modify the connection settings, such as connection timeout, according to your product environment. \n\nANSWER\nSiebel adapter uses the Siebel API (Java Data Bean) to interact with the Siebel server. The Siebel API also provides a way to configure the connection settings on the client side.\nCreate a siebel.properties file and save it in the classpath of the adapter (For example, <adapter project>\\connectorModule) and restart the adapter and broker to pick up the settings to establish the required connections.\n\nThis is applicable for all supported brokers.\n\nA detailed description of the Siebel.properties file is given below:\n\nSiebel.properties File \n\nThe siebel.properties file, which is located in your classpath, can be used to provide default parameters for client applications connecting to Siebel applications using the Java Data Bean. \n\nThe table below shows the properties in the siebel.properties file.",

In the Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), using an administrator user ID, click Edit->Administer Users to check whether any users or groups have access to the Configuration navigator view.

In the middle Defined Tree pane on the workspace, expand the various \u201c+\u201d items, and with the help of someone who knows MQ queue managers in your environment, see if any of the expanded items reflect queue managers actually in your environment. There will be default and example items shipped with the product, but you are looking for names reflecting MQ at your site. If there are no names that reflect queue managers in your environment, then no one is using MQ Configuration.\n\nd.

This will force a digest change when you want a new one during a restart. \n\nChanging the digest setting generates different URLs, so the updated theme resources can be loaded from the server.

However, depending on the repository, case insensitive searches can be performed by doing the following:\n- For FileNet P8 repositories; set the Force Case Insensitive Search flag on the object store. \n- For Content Manager repositories; the administrator will firstly need to enable text search on metadata, then a text search will need to be done in ICN against the metadata by enclosing the metadata value in double",

A vulnerability exists where an unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a malformed HTTP POST request to the integration server HTTP listener. The attacker could use the information in the Java stack trace to identify the version of Apache Tomcat in use.\nCVSS Base Score: 5.3\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113806",

To achieve this, the data is marked with the so-called sequence number. The sequence number is incremented during every change, upload, scan, etc. Every import contains data starting from the sequence number reported during the last successful import to the current sequence number. \n\nWhen the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created. Because of that, it might happen that the sequence number after the restoration is lower than the sequence number reported during the last successful import. In such case, the first import after the database restoration does not include any data. After that import, the sequence number is updated and the next import contains new data. Depending on your scan settings, you might need to wait some time for the import that contains new data. \n\nWhen the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created.\n\nData for the period from the last successful import before the restoration of the database until the restoration is never imported (obviously, as the data was removed by restoring the DB) and needs to be"

This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. \n\nCAUSE\nThe DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. \n\nIt should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events.

This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. \n\n \n\nFile type: \n\nUsing a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]\nThis will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.\n\nThis is a useful method to capture sporadic problems.

The customization can filter out information that is not necessary to keep in the DW. A sample implementation is provided that removes information about all the rules that are not fired, which helps keep the size of the trace small when there is a large number of rules in the ruleset and typically a much smaller number of rules actually fire. Also, only the DW persisted trace is smaller, the original larger trace is still used by DVS to perform the tests involved",

After the upgrade you notice that in the Queue Manager error LOGs you see the following error message:\n\nAMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed for channel '????'. \nThe channel does not start. \n\nSYMPTOM\nError AMQ9716\n\n\nCAUSE\nWith the release of WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.0 the use of OCSP certificate revocation checking was included. With this new feature, most likely your SSL certificates have a OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) certificate extension embedded inside them. \n\n\nThis was ignored before V7.0.1.0. Now it is being used to verify the certificate. The most likely cause of the failure is that the system can not access the servers listed in the AIA. This then returns a UNKNOWN status when the check is done. The default action for MQ is to not allow the channel to start and the",

It will still do OCSP checking and if REVOKED is returned then the channel will not start. A GOOD return code will allow the channel to start. If UNKNOWN is returned it will not stop the channel from starting and the AMQ9716 will not be reported.\n\nUNIX and Linux systems add the following to qm.ini\nSSL:\nOCSPAuthentication=OPTIONAL\n\nTo set for a Windows Queue Manager, run the following command:\namqmdain reg YourQMgrName -c add -s SSL -v OCSPAuthentication=OPTIONAL\n\nThe OCSPAuthentication setting is also applicable to clients and can also be set in the client ini file",

The agent is configured to monitor all the queue managers (QMGRS) on the same lpar, however, we can see the agent sometimes issues the 'alter Qlocal' command on a QMGR. Why is the agent issuing this command? \n\nANSWER\nWhen a queue full event occurs, WebSphere MQ will disable the event. To ensure that subsequent queue full events will occur, the OMEGAMON XE for Messaging agent will re-enable the queue full event once it determines the queue is no longer full via an ALTER QL(qname) QDPMAXEV(ENABLED) command. Other than Take Action commands, this is the only ALTER command that the",

Although these connections will eventually be discarded through the normal processing of the connection requests, it may be desirable to purge them all at once and allow the pool to refill with new, valid connections.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool.

Use an action like BlankPagesIDBySize to identify the blank page:  * BlankPagesIDBySize (1000,DeleteMe)\n    \n    \n 3. Create a rule with the action DeleteChildType(DeleteMe) and attach it at the batch level to have it remove all pages with page type DeleteMe.\n\n\nIf building a custom action, the DeleteChild API method is invoked from the parent object."

The DE normally uses the FQDN appended to the \"acsi_\" string to create the DE directory:\n\nFor example, if the Product is being installed as user \"nc_admin\" and the entry in /etc/hosts is this:\n\nx.xx.xxx.xx server_name.corporation.net server_name\n\nThe hostname is \"server_name\"\nFully Qualified hostname (FQDN) is \"server_name.corporation.net\"\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nUpgrading existing product that uses the Deployment Engine on a UNIX server\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nOutput similar to this when the Product install fails: \n\nthe Tivoli Deployment Engine (DE) located at \"/home/nc_admin/.acsi_<Fully qualified hostname>\". \nHowever you are now using the DE located at",

There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.\n    \n    \n 2.

An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. \nThis vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.\n\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)",

This behavior ensures that the installer does not overwrite product files that are currently running. The best practice is to shut down all components, including monitoring servers, portal server, and portal clients before you perform any product upgrade. This limitation only affects silent installations. Installations through the installation wizard is not affected.\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nAny Windows version \n\nAny ITM component installed silently\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nLook in <ITMHOME>\\InstallITM for a file name with syntax similar to: \nAbortIBMTivoliMonitoring<DATE TIME>.log\n\nFor example:\nAbortIBMTivoliMonitoring20150409",

Search the installation log for instances of the CheckLockedFiles string. Locked files are listed at these places. Locked files are files that might need to be upgraded during an installation, and because they are in use (locked) the silent install terminates.\n\n\n2. Identify the process that is locking the files.\n\n\n3. Stop the process.\n\n\n4. Prevent file locking by modifying the response file for installation file. This step is required when a silent installation has terminated. \n\na. Open the response file in a text editor. In many cases, the file in which you make this modification is named silent.txt. On Windows, the file to modify is the NT_Silent_Install.txt file that is located on the monitoring server.\nb.

If your LTPA Token is also expired, then the user will be asked to re-login. Also, the cache timeout period is reset every time that entry is hit. So, if the entry is hit 9 minutes into the 10 minute timeout period, the clock is reset at that time.

In the above example, this is the unicode character 0x0, but there are a number of other unicode characters that can cause the same result. The problem does not occur in the WebSphere Adapter itself because the WebSphere Adapters are entirely capable of handling full unicode data. Rather, the problem happens in some brokers which fail to properly serialize the incoming data into a valid XML object.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe only complete solution at this time is to not process unicode characters that are not valid in XML. This can be done by not importing data fields that might contain such characters or by purging such characters from the incoming data source. It is not sufficient to do filtering in the BO maps since the broker can still run into problems prior to this Java\u2122 mapping. \n\n\nIf handling of fields containing these unicode characters is essential to your use case, it will be necessary to open",

This action causes the other component attributes to be displayed for configuration. IBM PureData Systems for Analytics - nzsql error, Records trailing spring space set to 512 is too small - United States netezza PDA TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What does the message \"ERROR: Records trailing spring space set to 512 is too small...\" mean? \n\nANSWER\nThe following error may appear in the pg.log file: \n\nERROR: Records trailing spring space set to 512 is too small : Bump it up using the environment variable NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE \n\nThis error can occur when a query includes multiple aggregates against varchar or nvarchar columns. As the query is being processed the system allocates memory for each row of the result set. This includes each of the GROUP BY columns and each of the aggregates. For queries doing aggregates on variable length columns, the total length of the record will vary during the process. For example, if the current min value is \"Boston\" and the new min value is \"Albuquerque\" space for the new min value needs to increase. \n\nThe NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE is an extra",
                    "of the record will vary during the process. For example, if the current min value is \"Boston\" and the new min value is \"Albuquerque\" space for the new min value needs to increase. \n\nThe NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE is an extra pseudo-column that is tacked onto each row. It does not contain any data. It is a filler that starts out at NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE and then dynamically shrinks and expands as needed to keep each of the aggregate rows at a fixed length. There is a single springfield in each grouping record that has to shrink and grow to offset the combined changes in width of the running values for all min/max aggregates. \n\nTo avoid this error message, increase the value for this parameter as follows: \n\n1. nzstop\n2. export NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE=1024\n3. nzstart \n\nYou can confirm that the environment variable took effect by running the command \"nzsystem showregistry\". The output should contain the following: \"system.maxSpringFieldSize = 1024\". \n\nUnfortunately, the setting for NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE will revert to its default value the next time the database is stopped and started without the NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE environment variable being set. To ensure that the setting",
                    "= 1024\". \n\nUnfortunately, the setting for NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE will revert to its default value the next time the database is stopped and started without the NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE environment variable being set. To ensure that the setting persists after every database restart, do the following:\n1. Add the following line to the /nz/data/config/system.cfg file. (Create the file if it does not exist.) \n\nsystem.maxSpringFieldSize = 1024\n2. nzstop\n3. nzstart \n\nIf 1024 does not work, try higher values. Setting the limit may take a little trial and error. Increasing this value should not have a noticeable impact on other system performance. \n\n \n\nNote: \"By default 512 bytes is allocated to each row taking part in aggregations. By increasing this value by 512 we allocate over 30MB more memory for every 1 000 000 rows participating in aggregations. This is for one query, there might be other queries in the system which do aggregations as well. The more memory that is allocated for NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE (for each row) the less memory left for other processes. Having said this, it is not uncommon to see NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE set",

We would like to change the location the results of the output. \n\nANSWER\nThe job data is stored as metadata. There is no query or batch process that can be run to do a mass update to change the location of your results tab.

Installing the Fix Pack for the appropriate platform should be similar to the instructions for installing your server given in the SPSS Statistics Server Installation Instructions. It is suggested to copy off the spssdxcfg.ini prior to the installation on the UNIX / Linux server as the installation may remove the R section in spssdxcfg.ini and may require manual updating after FP2 installation \n\n 1. Download the Fix Pack to a directory on the server machine. \n 2. Shut down Statistics Server prior to applying the Fix Pack. \n 3. You need to ensure the ownership and permissions for the /bin, /lib and /common subdirectories of the Statistics installation directory. For example, if you installed as root, to change the ownership and permissions, go to Statistics installation directory and run the following commands at the UNIX prompt: \n    \n    chown -R root:root bin lib commonchmod -R 777 bin lib common \n 4. When running SPSS Statistics Server with internal authentication, a regular user can be the owner of these directories. Refer to the",
                    "chown -R root:root bin lib commonchmod -R 777 bin lib common \n 4. When running SPSS Statistics Server with internal authentication, a regular user can be the owner of these directories. Refer to the SPSS Statistics Server Administrator\u2019s Guide for more information. \n 5. The Fix Pack can be installed silently using the installer.properties file that comes with the 24.0 release (on the DVD): ./<installer_name> -f installer.properties where <installer_name> is the installer .bin file that you ftp'ed to the server. \n 6. You can also execute the installer directly to launch a graphical version of the installer. (Note: You will need an X Window System to do so): ./<installer_name>\n    Note for graphical installer: You should change the default installer directory for the patch in the Install Wizard to point it to the directory on the server where Statistics Server 24.0 is installed. \n 7. Start the Statistics Server after the Fix Pack installation is complete. \n 8. Run ./statisticsb and enter SHOW VERSION. The response should indicate 24.00.00.02\n\nDOWNLOAD PACKAGE\n\n\n\nDownload RELEASE DATE LANGUAGE SIZE(Bytes) Download"

For Java EE environments, MQ provides a Resource Adapter called wmq.jmsra.rar which contains the jar files required by JMS applications. Java SE and Java EE applications must use a consistent set of MQ jar files at the same maintenance level, or else they might experience a wide variety of problems including intermittent errors, performance problems, and other failures.\n\nIt is common to find multiple versions of the MQ jar files in the Java CLASSPATH, or invalidly bundled in Java applications (.ear, .war, and .jar files).

If the com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar file shows an implementation version of ${version.number} - ${build.level} just ignore it.\n\nIn the sample output above, entries #16 through #27 represent the jar files for the installed MQ Resource Adapter.

In this case, the plug-in config will use a wildcard with the application context-root like \"/myapp/*\". That way every URL starting with /myapp/* will be routed to the application in WAS.\n\nOn the other hand,",
                    "use fileServingEnabled=\"true\" in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file. That will cause the plug-in to use a wildcard entry for the context-root of your web application. For example, if the context-root is \"myapp\", then there will be a URI entry for \"/myapp/*\" in the plug-in config, and everything starting with \"myapp\" will be routed to the application in WAS. \n\n\nNow, if you also want to be able to serve some of the static files from the IHS web server itself, you will need to do a trick using RewriteRule in the IHS config. Here is how the trick works:\n\n1) Create a subdirectory called \"static\" under the IHS DocumentRoot directory. And put the static files that you want IHS to serve into that directory. For example in the IHS document root directory (HTTPServer/htdocs/) create a subdirectory called \"static\". Something like this:\n/usr/IBM/HTTPServer/htdocs/static/\n\n2) In your web application, you will reference those files using relative references like \"static/picture.jpg\", or \"static/mystyles.css\".\n\nThose relative references will be interpreted as URLs like",
                    "For the static files in the application, you will need to put them in some other directory that is NOT called \"static\", for example \"images/sunset.jpg\" would be a directory and file in the myapp application. This URL request, would be handled by the Plug-in and sent to the application in WAS:\nhostname/myapp/images/sunset.jpg\n\n\nSo, by using the trick described above, some static files will be served from IHS, like:\n/hostname/myapp/static/picture.jpg\n\nBut other static files will be served from the web application running in WAS, like:\n/hostname/myapp/images/sunset.jpg IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect IBM SOA Policy Gateway Pattern for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2.5 (CVE-2015-4000) - United States  SECURITY BULLETIN\n\nSUMMARY\n The LogJam Attack on Diffie-Hellman ciphers (CVE-2015-4000) may affect some configurations of IBM SOA Policy Gateway Pattern for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2.5. \n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nCVEID: CVE-2015-4000",

That way every URL starting with /myapp/* will be routed to the application in WAS.\n\nOn the other hand, fileServingEnabled=\"false\" means NO static files will be served from the application in WAS. In this case, a wildcard will NOT be used in the plugin-cfg.xml file. Instead, there will be several URI entries matching the URL-Patterns from <servlet-mappings> in the web.xml, like \"/myapp/servlet1\" and \"/myapp/index.jsp\". Requests for dynamic content matching the URI entries in the Plug-in config, will be routed to the application in WAS. But everything else (static content) will be handled by the IHS web server itself.\n\n\nANSWER\nIf you want to serve any static files (JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc) from your web application in WAS, you must use fileServingEnabled=\"true\" in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file. That will cause the plug-in to use a wildcard entry for the context-root of your web application. For example, if the context-root is \"myapp\", then",

But that is ok.\n\n3) Now, in the IHS config, you must use RewriteCond and RewriteRule to watch for these references, and redirect to get them from IHS. For example, look at these directives...\n\n<ifModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteRule ^/myapp/static/(.*) /static/$1 [PT]\n</ifModule>\n\nIt means, if the URI begins with /myapp/static/* then IHS will rewrite it to just /static/* and \"pass-through\". Since /static/* does NOT match anything in the Plug-in config, the request will be handled by IHS, and the file will be served from the static directory under IHS DocumentRoot.\n\nTo the user looking at the URL in the browser they will see"

                    "answer": "When tuning WebSphere Portal at version 6.0 and beyond, one of the concerns that arises is how should one tune the maximum number of Portal datasources. Portal can and does make heavy internal use of datasources, so miscalculating this (maximum) value can have a significant impact on system behavior. Out of the box, the default maximum setting is 50. This may or may not be sufficient for any given system. \n\nEach Portal request may make any number of database (DB) requests ranging for none to several.. Further, customized portlets and PPR (Parallel Portlet Rendering) may cause several concurrent DB requests. By default, the maximum number of WebContainer threads is also set to 50. Therefore the ratio between the maximum number of Portal datasource connections to the maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads is 1:1. Support has found that this ratio is often too low for the best performance. In the past, there have been recommendations of this ratio as high as of 2:1 or even 2.5:1. \n\nHowever, these values caused concern in large deployments where the TOTAL number of maximum datasource connections might start to place a strain on backend resources. Recent analysis suggests that these ratio values may be safely reduced to 1.25: 1 for all Portal datasource, with the exception of the jcrDB when WCM is used extensively. In this case, we recommend a ratio of 1.5:1",

Portal can and does make heavy internal use of datasources, so miscalculating this (maximum) value can have a significant impact on system behavior. Out of the box, the default maximum setting is 50. This may or may not be sufficient for any given system. \n\nEach Portal request may make any number of database (DB) requests ranging for none to several.. Further, customized portlets and PPR (Parallel Portlet Rendering) may cause several concurrent DB requests. By default, the maximum number of WebContainer threads is also set to 50. Therefore the ratio between the maximum number of Portal datasource connections to the maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads is 1:1. Support has found that this ratio is often too low for the best performance. In the past, there have been recommendations of this ratio",

Support has found that this ratio is often too low for the best performance. In the past, there have been recommendations of this ratio as high as of 2:1 or even 2.5:1. \n\nHowever, these values caused concern in large deployments where the TOTAL number of maximum datasource connections might start to place a strain on backend resources. Recent analysis suggests that these ratio values may be safely reduced to 1.25: 1 for all Portal datasource, with the exception of the jcrDB when WCM is used extensively. In this case, we recommend a ratio of 1.5:1 \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nFor example, if your system's \n\nMaximum number of WebContainer threads is 100 \n\nthen you should set your \n\nMaximum number of Portal datasource connections to 125 \n\nfor each Portal datasource. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nIf during Runtime, you should find that your running out of Portal Datasource connections, you may go ahead and increase the ratio up to 2:1.

Make a copy of <wp_profile>/PortalServer/derby/wpsdb to a backup directory. Since the version of Derby used in WebSphere Portal is embedded, you must stop the Portal server before you can access the database although you can always work on the backup copy.\n\nNOTE: For simplicity, we will omit the extension of the utilities.

It can be used to run DDL for creating database, tables, indexes, and so on. In a WebSphere Portal environment, it would typically be used for exporting data or making simple changes (when advised by IBM Support). \n\nTo start ij, simply open a command prompt or terminal window, change the directory and enter the command. You should then see the ij shell with prompt \"ij>\". \n\nThe following are some common commands that you may use when reviewing data in the Portal database.  * \n * ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\derby\\wpsdb';\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij>",

The only workaround is to create a new instance with a new encryption seed value and then use the db2ldif and ldif2db utilities to export and import data respectively. These utilities can be supplied with the new encryption seed and the salt value of the new instance. Thus the data would be preserved(alongwith the passwords) on this new instance.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Set up a new instance says \"newinst\".\n\n$> idsicrt -I newinst -e thisismyencryptionseed -l (/home/newinst) -n\n\n$> idscfgdb -I newinst -w ldap -a newinst -t newinst -l (/home/newinst) -n\n\n$> idscfgsuf -s",
                    "-l (/home/newinst) -n\n\n$> idscfgdb -I newinst -w ldap -a newinst -t newinst -l (/home/newinst) -n\n\n$> idscfgsuf -s \"o=ibm,c=us\" -I newinst -n\n\n$> idsdnpw -u cn=root -p root -I newinst -n\n\n2. Note the encryption seed - \"thisismyencryptionseed\". Let us call this new_encryptionseed\n\n3. Once this new instance is setup note down the salt value generated by the new server instance by searching for \"cn=crypto,cn=localhost\".\n\n$> ldapsearch -D <administrator DN> -w <administrator password> -b \"cn=crypto,cn=localhost\" -s base objectclass=* ibm-slapdCryptoSalt\n\nLet us call this value: new_saltvalue\n\n4. Lets assume that the instance name with the forgotten encryption seed is \"oldinst\"\n\n5. Use the db2ldif utility on the instance with the forgotten encryptionseed, oldinst with the following options -\n\n$> db2ldif -o outputfile -I oldinst -k new_encryptionseed -t",
                    "\"oldinst\"\n\n5. Use the db2ldif utility on the instance with the forgotten encryptionseed, oldinst with the following options -\n\n$> db2ldif -o outputfile -I oldinst -k new_encryptionseed -t new_saltvalue\n\n6. Once this step is successfully completed the entire data from \"oldinst\" would be dumped in outputfile.\n\n7. Use the utilities like ldif2db to re-load all the data into the new server instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER IBM WebSphere Portal startup fails with EJCBC0002E: The service [<serviceName>] could not be located. - United States EJCBC0002E; EJPFD0016E; extensionregistry; CORFriendlySelectionServiceHome TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM\nWhen starting the WebSphere_Portal server, startup throws an exception: EJCBC0002E: The service could not be located. \n\nSYMPTOM\nIn the SystemOut.log, the following exception can be seen at the time the wps.ear application is started:\n===========================\n[1/13/11 11:00:56:875 EST] 00000015 Servlet E com.ibm.wps.engine.Servlet",

Portal can and does make heavy internal use of datasources, so miscalculating this (maximum) value can have a significant impact on system behavior. Out of the box, the default maximum setting is 50. This may or may not be sufficient for any given system. \n\nEach Portal request may make any number of database (DB) requests ranging for none to several.. Further, customized portlets and PPR (Parallel Portlet Rendering) may cause several concurrent DB requests. By default, the maximum number of WebContainer threads is also set to 50. Therefore the ratio between the maximum number of Portal datasource connections to the maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads is 1:1. Support has found that this ratio is often too low for the best performance. In the past, there have been recommendations of this ratio"

Initially we suggest setting the value to 1200000, which is 20 minutes.

Since HPEL lets you format and filter your log content after it has been persisted to the HPEL log/trace repository, this lets you decide if you want to see your application content on its own (helpful for uncluttered debug of an application), or together with the application server log/trace content (helpful to see impact of server on applications, and vice versa). \n\nFor example, if",

This is where SLF4J or Logback can come in handy, as you can use them to intercept Log4J calls and forward them to the logging implementation of your choice. In order to integrate well with WAS logs/trace, we would recommend you bind your SLF4J/Logback API to map your log/trace content to JUL -- this will give you the ability to see your logs/trace in the WAS log/trace files, and enable you to have easy admin console control over all of your loggers.\n\n3. How can I get WAS logs to go to syslog or the Windows EventLog?\n\nThere are a number of places that users have asked to be able to direct logs to in the past. Most notably, a number of customers have asked for the ability to send logs to syslog.\n\nWebSphere Application Server sends all of its logs to java.util.logging (JUL), and customers can customize what happens to the log/trace events by way of using JUL Handlers. Once content is sent to JUL, it can be handled in a variety of flexible ways:\n\n1) By default, we",

We also send the log content over JMX notifications, which allows for remote access.\n\n2) If customers want to send content to places like SMTP, syslog, event log, or a few other places, they can use SLF4J to route WAS logs to Log4J, and use the corresponding Log4J Appenders. In this configuration, WAS logging routes to java.util.logging, SLF4J's Handler routes the request to Log4J, and Log4J can be configured to write log records to a syslog Appender. \n\n3) If users want to do something even more custom, they can write their own JUL Handlers and plug them into WebSphere Application Server. \n\n4.

JUL provides a good, ubiquitous logging infrastructure, which is suitable for most applications, and integrates with WebSphere Application Server log and trace. Using JUL directly also avoids extra log/trace API \"hops\" that are introduced by using other log/trace frameworks that map to JUL. The WAS logs are generated using JUL Handlers connected to the root JUL Logger.\n\nIn case you don't want to use JUL, or you have code that is already instrumented with another logging package, SLF4J or Logback can be helpful. For example, you may have code already written with Log4J. Log4J log/trace is not routed to WAS log/trace files, and Log4J loggers don't show up in the WAS tree of loggers you can control from the admin console.

Be sure to include the longest running requests that take the most time to respond. Then choose a value for ServerIOTimeout that is much larger (2X or 3X or more) than the longest response time. This method will ensure that your ServerIOTimeout is high enough to allow adequate time for the application to respond normally. Make it a negative value so that if the ServerIOTimeout pops, the plug-in will immediately mark the server down, and retry the request to a different appserver.\n\n\nServerIOTimeoutRetry can be used to decrease the number of retries after ServerIOTimeout has fired. By default, the Plug-in will try a request equal to the number of members in the cluster. For example, if the cluster has four members, and there is a ServerIOTimeout, the Plug-in will try it a second time. If the retry fails with ServerIOTimeout fired, then it will try a third time, and a fourth time if needed. But after four attempts, the Plug-in will give up and"

The web server Plug-in will look for the session cookie and use the clone ID to send the request to that specific WAS app server. An affinity request is not load balanced.\n\nIn the plug-in config there is a property called IgnoreAffinityRequests. This property determines if affinity requests will affect the load balance weights, or not. The default value for IgnoreAffinityRequests is True, which means that affinity requests will not have any affect on the load balance weights. This is best for environments where there are no, or few, affinity requests. On the other hand, for an environment with a lot of affinity requests, it may be better to set IgnoreAffinityRequests to False so that the load balance weights will accurately reflect the effect of having a lot of affinity requests.\n\n\nFail-over occurs when the plug-in marks a cluster member appserver (or clone) as \"down\", and then sends the pending requests to other members of the same cluster.

If the application running in WebSphere Application Server is handling requests quickly, each request will only be PENDING for a very short time. So, under ideal conditions, MaxConnections is not needed and therefore the default is (-1) meaning unlimited. However, sometimes an application may start to become overwhelmed and the application may not be able to handle the requests as quickly. Consequently Pending Requests start to build up. MaxConnections can be used to put a limit on the number of PENDING requests per server. When the MaxConnections limit is reached, the plug-in will stop sending requests to that appserver, but it is not marked down. The optimal value for MaxConnections will depend on how quickly the application and appserver respond to each request. If normal responses are returned in less than one second, it may be appropriate to set a low value for MaxConnections, like 20 or so. However, if it normally takes several seconds to get a response from the application, then it would be prudent to use a higher value for MaxConnections, like 100.

The default password is blank. \n\nOne will have to edit the HSQLDB DataSource to enable it to connect to the database with the new password. \n\nA) One method is by encrypting the password and editing the HSQLDB DataSource to allow DSA connection. Use nci_crypt to encrypt the password - for example: \n\n * \n * \n * \n\n\nedit the file: \n\n * \n\n\nto alter the property: \n\n * \n\n\nfrom the default value of {aes}9C71E0F544E705326E2B5CBDFC54CE46 to the new encrypted password value - for example: \n\n * \n\n\nThis requires an ImpactServer restart to enable. \n\nB) An alternate method is to edit the DataSource via the normal Impact configuration GUI and provide the new password there.

Even though a DB2 trace is not turned on, it may issue semget() calls to the operating system. These calls will fail, though, since no IPC resources were acquired.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe trace facility has an \"alloc\" option that can allocate necessary IPC resources. When you issue db2start, internal functions equivalent to command db2trc alloc are automatically issued, and when you issue db2stop, the trace segment will be removed if no one is using it.\n\nSince a DB2 client does not necessarily have the ability to perform the db2start command, no IPC's will be automatically allocated for the trace facility, and hence the problem.\n\nThe solution is to issue the following command at the DB2 client:\n\ndb2trc alloc\n\nThis will then create the necessary IPC resources, and prevent the semget() calls from failing (since the semget() call now has IPC resources that it can use).

For key export to work, various conditions must be met: \n\n * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines \n * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) \n * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.\n\n\nEach HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don't need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the",
                    "all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization). \n\nSecond, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command's exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable. \n\nFinally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command). \n\nOnce all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import. \n\nNote",

The process id and the date stamp are normally appended to the name of the file. \n\n\n\n\nProcessing the Dump \n\nExecute the jextract command on the same system and installation of WebSphere Application Server that the core dump was produced on. If you don't use the full path on AIX or Linux, make sure to use ./jextract (including the dot-slash) so the correct executable is picked up. \n\nReplace [COREDUMP_PATH] with the full path plus filename of the core dump produced. \n\n \n\nIf you do not know if compressed references is enabled, scroll to the FAQ section for a brief explanation. \n\n \n\nDetermining the Java Directory \n\nBecause different profiles on WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.X and later can use different SDKs, the java directory inside the installation folder can differ.

The following information presents some options for formulating an approach that best fits your environment.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nFirst, know your certificate material. It's not uncommon for newer certificates to be chained, so it is not a one for one replacement; the existing certificate on the DataPower appliance may need to be replaced by more than one certificate. Therefore, it is important to ensure you have the full certificate chain, as appropriate (i.e, the personal, intermediate and root certificates). Certificate authorities may send two certificates in the chain and expect the third one to be downloaded from their website. \n\n\nHere's a screenshot of a sample chain. Notice that you can check the 'Certification Path' tab if there are any remaining certificates in the chain. Also note the chain of \"Issued To\" and \"Issued By\" identities.\nExampleCertificateChain.jpg"

The following information presents some options for formulating an approach that best fits your environment.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nFirst, know your certificate material. It's not uncommon for newer certificates to be chained, so it is not a one for one replacement; the existing certificate on the DataPower appliance may need to be replaced by more than one certificate. Therefore, it is important to ensure you have the full certificate chain, as appropriate (i.e, the personal, intermediate and root certificates). Certificate authorities may send two certificates in the chain and expect the third one to be downloaded from their website. \n\n\nHere's a screenshot of a sample chain. Notice that you can check the 'Certification Path' tab if there are any remaining certificates in the chain. Also note the chain of \"Issued To\" and \"Issued By\" identities.\nExampleCertificateChain.jpg",

The following information presents some options for formulating an approach that best fits your environment.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nFirst, know your certificate material. It's not uncommon for newer certificates to be chained, so it is not a one for one replacement; the existing certificate on the DataPower appliance may need to be replaced by more than one certificate. Therefore, it is important to ensure you have the full certificate chain, as appropriate (i.e, the personal, intermediate and root certificates). Certificate authorities may send two certificates in the chain and expect the third one to be downloaded from their website. \n\n\nHere's a screenshot of a sample chain. Notice that you can check the 'Certification Path' tab if there are any remaining certificates in the chain. Also note the chain of \"Issued To\" and \"Issued By\" identities.\nExampleCertificateChain.jpg",

In addition, an LDAP timeout message is added to the SystemOut.log file. \n\nSYMPTOM\nWhen you do a broad search with a small keyword, you expect to receive many entries in return. When your search is more specific, you use a longer keyword to try to narrow the search. However, when you expect fewer returns from your search, it does not happen. The user list remains empty. \n\nYou can find the following exception in the SystemOut.log file:\n\n[8/7/12 14:02:59:435 CEST] 000000xx exception E com.ibm.ws.wim. \nadapter.ldap.LdapConnection search(String, String, Object[], \nSearchControls) CWWIM4520E The 'javax.naming.NamingException: LDAP \nresponse read timed out, timeout used:20000ms.; Remaining name: \n'DC=xxx,DC=xxx,DC=xxx,DC=com'; Resolved object:",

Is there a solution to this issue? \n\nCAUSE\nIf the value of Retry Attempts is set to 0 on the DataPower MQ Queue Manager object, this negates the benefits of the Long Retry Interval since it will not be used.

The default setting of Retry Attempts as 0 and Retry Interval as 1 second is provided to preserve backward compatibility. However, these default values should be changed to take advantage of Long Retry Interval feature available in firmware.\n\nANSWER\nThe solution to the issue of having DataPower vulnerable to the MQ Queue Manager being inaccessible is to change the Retry Attempts parameter on the Configure MQ Queue Manager window from 0 to some number. As an example, change the parameters as follows: \n\n *  Retry Attempts - change the default of 0 to 6 Retry Interval - change the default of 1 to 10 seconds Long Retry Interval - change the default of 1800 to 600 seconds (10 minutes) \n\n\nIn the event that the Queue Manager is down or a connection is not established, the above example configuration will allow the MQ QM Object to retry 6 times with 10 second intervals. After 6 attempts, the MQ QM object will retry every 10 minutes.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI50 Firmware 3.8 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Low Latency Appliance XM70 Firmware",

Datacap thick clients (DotScan, DotEdit) and utilities (NENU, Fingerprint Maintenance Tool) require LAN communication speeds and low latency for responsive performance. \n\nConnect all Datacap Taskmaster Servers, Rulerunner Servers, Web Servers, file servers and databases to a single high performance LAN for best results. Network delays between Taskmaster Server, shared files and databases causes degraded performance of Job Monitor and data intensive operations. \n\nSome customers successfully operate Datacap thick clients in remote sites using Citrix or other remote access technology. IBM has not tested or sought certification with Citrix, and does not provide support for Citrix.

The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is \nnegotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.\n\nThere are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object: \n\nCase #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as\n\n\u00b7 Administrator stop-quiesce\n\u00b7 Heartbeating \n\u00b7 Read ahead \n\u00b7 Client asynchronous consume\n\nSet a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\n\nCase #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel",

The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server's allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager.

                    "due to Leap Year. \n\nThere are no known or expected problems.\n(Details below) \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWebSphere Application Server and the SDK are leap year compliant. IBM Java (SDK / JDK) has been doing leap year testing/verification since 1996, including the non-leap year 2000 without a problem. Basically leap years in Java are explicitly supported by the GregorianCalendar class - that is it's function - and this class is tested with every release of Java as it is part of Java's core functionality. So any Java code which uses the GregorianCalendar class will behave correctly. \n\nWebSphere Application Server performs no specific leap year testing since it runs on top of the SDK which is compliant, and uses function from it. We are not aware of any issues in the past with WebSphere Application Server associated with leap year. \n\nFrom a JDK perspective, Java applications which use the GregorianCalendar class will be leap-year compliant - see the spec at: \n\n(Same info in the links for the various JDK's) \n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html]",

The EventReader captures the event and then uses the highest captured StateChange value in its outgoing SQL to capture pertinent events.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nPertinent events are not being processed. Looking in the EventReader log file the number of events being captured in each Read is 0. Testing the SQL being used in an nco_sql session produces a 0 result too. Testing the SQL again in an nco_sql session without the \"and StateChange >= 1234567890\" clause returns all the unprocessed rows.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nSomething has \"future dated\" the StateChange value of an event in the ObjectServer, the EventReader captured the event and, since the EventReader will use the highest StateChange value captured in the previous poll in the SQL of its next poll, this then future dated the value used in the EventReader. The EventReader will persist with this value (and will increment it by 1 every other poll) until such a time as it",

The EventReader will persist with this value (and will increment it by 1 every other poll) until such a time as it captures an event with a higher StateChange value.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest solution is to manually reset the EventReader StateChange value via the GUI. Stop the EventReader, open it for edit, click the \"Clear State\" button, exit the editor and restart the EventReader.\n\nAn alternate solution is to perform this operation via the Command Line Interface:\n\n\n\n * telnet [Hostname] [Port]\n\n\nwhere [Hostname] is the resolvable hostname of the ImpactServer host and [Port] is the CLI port number (2000, by default). You will need to supply a suitable username (admin, for example) and password. Then at the READY prompt enter the series of commands: \n\n * Update Service set Running=false where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n * \n * Update Service set ClearState=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n * \n * Update Service set Running=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n\n\nwhere [EventReaderName] is the name of the EventReader that requires this restart process.",

In most instances, this object is the attribute that was put into the session object; however, sometimes this object is referenced by an attribute of the session object. \n\n To determine which attribute of the session object references this non-serializable object, access the SessionInspectServlet.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nImplement the Java.io.Serializable or Java.io.Externalizable interface\n\nWith persistent sessions enabled, any object that is put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface in order for session manager to store the session data outside of JVM.\n\nWhen PMI is enabled, there is a counter for session data size. In order to evaluate this counter, the session data must be serialized into a byte array stream.

IBM How to make persistent the events for starting and stopping an MQ queue manager - United States  WHITE PAPER\n\nABSTRACT\n This techdoc provides all the necessary steps to help you monitor the queue SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT to audit the start and the stop for a MQ queue manager. \n\nCONTENT\nFirst, a baseline scenario is described in which when using the defaults, there is only 1 record in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue, regardless of how many times you restart the queue manager.\n\n\nSecond, a modification is done to the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue to indicate that the default persistence is enabled, and thus, subsequent events from the stop/start of the queue manager will be kept in the queue.\nalter ql(SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT) defpsist(YES)\n\nCaveat:\nIf you want to have persistent messages in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue you will need to have discipline and a procedure to get and remove the messages, otherwise, the queue will eventually fill up.\n\n\n\nFile: How to make persistent the events for starting and stopping an",

This command-line tool can gather log file or configuration information and upload it to a Problem Management Record (PMR). This collector is also included in IBM Business Process Manager V8.0.1 Fix Pack 3. \n\nCONTENT\nThe script gathers various product information, compresses it into a .zip file, and can optionally send the compressed file to IBM for a PMR. You can also use this tool to compress the data without sending it to IBM. The command is profile_root/bin/bpmdc\nThe profile_root variable is the base profile directory for the profile from which you want to get data. \n\nCommon Examples \n\nTo gather the logs and upload them to ECURep: \nC:/MyProfileDirectory/bin/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes \n\nTo gather the logs and config",
                    "is only collected when the -config=yes option is used.\n\n\nNote: The limitation with this collection is that it does not gather log files and trace if it goes to a custom directory outside of the Profile logs directory. It is not recommended that you change the log file locations from the default as it makes it more difficult for other people to find them. \n\nInstall collection\nThe \"Install\" collection gathers the following information that is listed in the Collect troubleshooting data for installation or upgrade problems with IBM Business Process Manager products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21506937] document: \n\n * Any temporary launchpad log files. \n * Installation Manager Data directory \n * The results of the versionInfo -maintenancePackages command \n * Installation logs directory \n * Profile logs directory \n * Database upgrade script log files \n * Various configuration files that are related to the installation process\n\n\n\n\nJVM Dump collection The \"Dump\" collection type triggers various JVM dumps on a target server within a profile prior to gathering the general collection and generated dumps. \n\nWith the provided server connection options, the command will connect to the server using the soapport to make a wsadmin connection with the user and password. Depending on the dump type, it will trigger various JVM",
                    "some common usage scenarios for this command: \n\n * After an issue occurs, use the basic bpmdc command to compress the log files for the profile into a .zip file. \n * Recreate your issue after setting a trace string using the administrative console [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/ttrb_entrrs.html] or wsadmin [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/txml_troubleshooting.html]. \n   Then, run the bpmdc command to collect the log files and send them to IBM. \n * After opening a PMR, use bpmdc-PMR=PMRnumber-uploadToIBM=yes with the most relevant type options to upload data. \n * IBM Support provides a specific command or set of commands to run for your environment that gets the needed data. \n * IBM Support provides a traces string that needs to be gathered with the commands.
